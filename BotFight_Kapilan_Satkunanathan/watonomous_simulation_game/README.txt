Hi so I couldn't finish it still debugging 
I have been stuck on line 19 of backend it throws an error that says expression must have a constant value.
I really tried my best these past 4 days and I know I'm past the due date but I really hope you can over look this lateness.
I have class tomorrow (Monday 1/14/2018) from 8:30 am to 9:30 pm(yeah tough day) so I won't be able to finish by tommorrow I will try to finish it by tuesday.

Thanks for your understanding,
Kapilan Satkunanathan
